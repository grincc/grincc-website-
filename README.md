## Adding new meeting notes.

1) You need to create a javascript file in /pages/meetings folder for each file.
File format is month_name-day-year such as february-15-2022.js or march-01-2022.js
2) You can use template in __/components/example-meeting-note.js. Copy and update content.
    You need following info to form meeting note's page.
    - Attendance list
    - Short summary
    - Voting results
    - Agenda Points
    - Discussion text (This is wrapped in <ReactMarkdown> component)
    - Action Points

4) Create a new item in main meeting list page which can be reached at /meetings. Each meeting's info is stored in JSON format like this
```
{
    date:"March 1, 2022",
    agendaPoints : [
        "Provide more exposure to Bisq and other exchanges.",
        "Overview on Grin CC github page and web site.",
        "Bounties for training videos on Bisq and Tradeogre.",
        "Discuss request for funding Groundskeeper @jankie / Mar-May 2022.",
    ],
    link: "/meetings/march-01-2022"
}

```



## Searching notes

You need to run 
```npm run build```
to create html files which will be parsed for content.

Then to update cached notes
```npm run cache-notes```
This will update cached data file at /cache/data.js
This data is being served at __/api/search?q=querytext__
