                        Since its launch in 2019, Grin development was funded by only donations. Donations to <a className="text-primary" href="https://grin.mw/fund">Grin General Fund</a> was controlled by <i>Original Grin Council</i> according to <a href="https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-rfcs/blob/master/text/0002-grin-governance.md">Grin Governance RFC</a>. After the last planned hard fork, this RFC has been replaced with <a href="https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-rfcs/blob/master/text/0016-simplify-governance.md">Simplify-Governance RFC</a>. Meanwhile community has raised its voice for supporting of more projects extendeding grin and its usability which was heard by <i>Original Grin Council</i>. One of Original Grin Council members, yeastplume made a <a href="https://gist.github.com/yeastplume/5d1913c7dc40c40f409ffcfe8fa9b094">proposition</a> to split <i>Grin Development Fund</i>, and give control to a second group (or more than one group) for decentralizing governance. After discussions of several different split strategies in governance meetings <a href="https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-pm/blob/master/notes/20210216-meeting-governance.md">²</a> <a href="https://github.com/newjack777/grin-pm/blob/master/notes/20210302-meeting-governance.md">³</a> and <a href="https://forum.grin.mw/t/call-for-grin-community-candidates-for-additional-fund-granting-control/8521">community</a>, it was decided to split Development Fund into two funds:

                    <ul className="pl-4 py-2">

                        <li>1. <i>Grin Development Fund</i> to support core grin development</li>
                        <li>2. <i>Grin Community Fund</i> to support community projects</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Community Council candidates are called for joining to council, among four of them (<i>dtavarez</i>, <i>hendi</i>, <i>mcmmike</i>, <i>paouky</i>) were <a href="https://forum.grin.mw/t/call-for-grin-community-candidates-for-additional-fund-granting-control/8521/3?u=stakerv">approved</a> by original Council. To allow more community participation two additional council members (<i>anynomous</i>, <i>future3000</i>) are selected only by <a href="https://forum.grin.mw/t/call-for-grin-community-candidates-for-additional-fund-granting-control/8521/13?u=stakerv">votes</a> of the community.
